# The Wing Man

The Wing Man aspires to be an intelligent Tinder swiper.

Currently, the project comprises 3 main components

- Automatic (dumb) swiper armed with a data extraction function to deliberately obtain and label pictures from Tinder.
- Data processing library to organize and clean up picture folders
- Early stages of what will eventually become a fine-tuned PyTorch swipe predictor based on ImageNet weights

Integration into a single framework that automatically swipes left or right is conducted continuously.
