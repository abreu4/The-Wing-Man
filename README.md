# The Wing Man

The Wing Man aspires to be an intelligent Tinder swiping helper.

Currently, the project comprises 3 main components

- Rather dumb automatic swiper armed with a data extraction function to deliberately obtain pictures from Tinder.
- Data processing library to organize and clean up picture folders
- Early stages of the NIMA PyTorch implementation as a predictor of aesthetic quality of pictures - currently being tested

Integration into a single framework that automatically swipes left or right is conducted continuously.
